       <h4>WHAT IS PHOTOGRAPHY </h4> 
      
         <p> First, let us define photography
          Before diving into the different mediums and types of photography that exist, let’s take a look at the general photography definition to understand the term. 
          PHOTOGRAPHY DEFINITION
          What is photography?
          To understand the photography definition, it is important to break down the word itself. The Greek meaning of ‘photo’ translates to ‘light’ while ‘graphy’ translates to ‘drawing.’ Therefore, the word photography can quite literally translate to light drawing or drawing with light. Simply put, photography is the process of capturing light to create an image. This is executed through the use of a camera, either film or digital. The practice of capturing light to create images is used for various purposes.</p>
         <h4> THE FIRST CAMERA </h4>
       <p>What year was the camera invented?
          When were cameras invented? In 1816 or 1685? The internet seems to throw around both dates, and credits two different people. A little history to clarify the confusion.
       CAMERAS WERE INVENTED WHEN?
        The camera was invented, or rather, developed by multiple people, over the course of history. But the camera, as we know it today, was invented by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in (about) 1816.
         Niépce technically took the first photo on a homemade camera, with silver chloride covered paper.
         While his first photograph was only partially successful, he is the inventor of the very first surviving photograph, which is a main reason why he is widely accepted as the inventor of the camera. It dates to 1826 or 1827, and is now in the permanent collection of the University of Texas-Austin.
         Who Else Had a Hand in Inventing the Camera?
         So, what’s this talk about 1685 then? Johann Zahn is usually co-credited with inventing the camera. 
         The German author wrote a ton about camera obscuras, lenses, and telescopes. It was in 1685 when he invented a design for the first handheld reflex camera. Johann Zahn was WAY ahead of his time as it would take another 150 years before this design became a reality. </p>

      <h4>
        What Is the Bare Minimum Gear Needed for Photography?</h4>
        <p><span>Camera.</span> If you buy a dedicated camera (rather than a phone), pick one with interchangeable lenses so that you can try out different types of photography more easily. Read reviews, but don’t obsess over them, because everything available today is pretty much equally good as its competition. Find a nice deal and move on.</p>

         <p>Lenses. This is where it counts. For everyday photography, start with a standard zoom lens like a 24-70mm or 18-55mm. For portrait photography, pick a prime lens (one that doesn’t zoom) at 35mm, 50mm, or 85mm. For sports, go with a telephoto lens. For macro photography, get a dedicated macro lens. And so on. Lenses matter more than any other piece of equipment because they determine what photos you can take in the first place.</p>

         <p>Post-processing software. One way or another, you need to edit your photos. It’s ok to start with software already on your computer, or software that comes with your camera. But in the long run, a dedicated program will do a better job. Adobe sells Lightroom and Photoshop as a bundle for $10/month, or you can buy standalone software from another company if you prefer; there are tons of options. Whatever you pick, stick with it for a while, and you’ll learn it quite well.

          <p>Everything else is optional, but can be very helpful:

        <p>A tripod. A landscape photographer’s best friend.

          <p>Bags. Get a shoulder bag for street photography, a rolling bag for studio photography, a technical hiking backpack for landscape photography, and so on.</p>

            <p>Memory cards. Choose something in the 64-128 GB range to start. Get a fast card (measured in MB/second) if you shoot bursts of photos, since your camera’s memory will clear faster.</p>

              <p>Extra batteries. Get at least one spare battery to start, preferably two. Off-brand batteries are usually cheaper, although they may not last as long or maintain compatibility with future cameras.</p>

                <p>Polarizing filter. This is a big one, especially for landscape photographers. Don’t get a cheap polarizer or it will harm your image quality. I recommend the B+W Kaesemann filter (of the same thread size as your lens).</p>

                  <p>Flash. Flashes can be expensive, and you might need to buy a separate transmitter and receiver if you want to use your flash off-camera. But for genres like portrait photography or macro photography, they’re indispensable.</p>

                    <p>Better computer monitor. Ideally, you would get an IPS monitor for editing photos (which we’ve also written an article about). A color calibration device is also really helpful, so you know you’re editing the “correct” colors.</p>

                      <p>Cleaning kit. The top item is a microfiber cloth to keep the front of your lens clean. Also get a rocket blower to remove dust from your camera sensor more easily.</p>
                      <p>Other equipment. There are countless other photography accessories available, from remote shutter releases to GPS attachments, printers, and more. Don’t worry about these at first; you’ll realize over time if you need one.</p>
