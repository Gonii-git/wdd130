    <h1>What Is Photography</h1>
    <p> First, let us define photography
        Before diving into the different mediums and types of photography that exist, let’s take a look at the general photography definition to understand the term. 
        PHOTOGRAPHY DEFINITION
        What is photography?
        To understand the photography definition, it is important to break down the word itself. The Greek meaning of ‘photo’ translates to ‘light’ while ‘graphy’ translates to ‘drawing.’ Therefore, the word photography can quite literally translate to light drawing or drawing with light. Simply put, photography is the process of capturing light to create an image. This is executed through the use of a camera, either film or digital. The practice of capturing light to create images is used for various purposes.</p>

                <h1> THE FIRST CAMERA </h1>
                <p>What year was the camera invented?
                    When were cameras invented? In 1816 or 1685? The internet seems to throw around both dates, and credits two different people. A little history to clarify the confusion.
                 CAMERAS WERE INVENTED WHEN?
                  The camera was invented, or rather, developed by multiple people, over the course of history. But the camera, as we know it today, was invented by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in (about) 1816.
                   Niépce technically took the first photo on a homemade camera, with silver chloride covered paper.
                   While his first photograph was only partially successful, he is the inventor of the very first surviving photograph, which is a main reason why he is widely accepted as the inventor of the camera. It dates to 1826 or 1827, and is now in the permanent collection of the University of Texas-Austin.
                   Who Else Had a Hand in Inventing the Camera?
                   So, what’s this talk about 1685 then? Johann Zahn is usually co-credited with inventing the camera. 
                   The German author wrote a ton about camera obscuras, lenses, and telescopes. It was in 1685 when he invented a design for the first handheld reflex camera. Johann Zahn was WAY ahead of his time as it would take another 150 years before this design became a reality. </p>
